Straighten legs, inhale and squeeze your abs then push the weight up overhead while exhaling, keep the bar path straight and bob your head out of the way as it passes. Keep your back straight and core tight as you reach the top, inhale at the top and slowly lower the bar back to your collarbone. Repeat for the required repetitions."/>
